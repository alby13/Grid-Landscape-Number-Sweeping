# Grid Landscape with Number Sweeping in Python
This program creates a dynamic, interactive 3D terrain using Pygame and OpenGL. It features a continuously morphing landscape with mountains that appear and change shape. Numerical height values sweep across the terrain, fading in and out based on their distance from the corner origin. The camera slowly rotates around the terrain, and you can control the zoom with the mouse wheel.
